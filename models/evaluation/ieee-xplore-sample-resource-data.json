        "year": 2009,
        "abstract": "The volumetric 3-D space of the images captured from an object is approximated into five lateral planes making simplification in transmission and display. Schemes transmitting the approximated images, their reception and display in volumetric display tank are presented. Selected display devices and systems producing efficiently the volumetric display are reported. A modified picture tube displaying five sectional images is also proposed. Furthermore, spatially located multiple screens producing the volumetric display with maximized optical transparency is explained. Lastly, a triorthogonal image pickup system is explored for its appropriateness for volumetric image transmission and display.",

        "year": 2008,
        "abstract": " In this letter, we develop the wavelet basis function neural networks (WBFNNs). It is analogous to radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and to wavelet neural networks (WNNs). In WBFNNs, both the scaling function and the wavelet function of a multiresolution approximation (MRA) are adopted as the basis for approximating functions. A sequential learning algorithm for WBFNNs is presented and compared to the sequential learning algorithm of RBFNNs. Experimental results show that WBFNNs have better generalization property and require shorter training time than RBFNNs. ",

        "year": 2021,
        "abstract": "We show that training neural classifiers with Bayesian bidirectional backpropagation improves the performance of the network. Bidirectional backpropagation trains a deep network for both forward and backward recall through the same layers of neurons and with the same weights. It maximizes the network's joint forward and backward likelihood. Bayesian bidirectional backpropagation combines prior probabilities at the input and output layers with the likelihood structure of the layers. It maximizes the posterior probability of the network. It differs from other forms of neural Bayesian estimation because it uses the bidirectional likelihood of the network instead of the unidirectional likelihood. Bayesian bidirectional backpropagation outperformed classifiers trained with both unidirectional and bidirectional backpropagation. The networks trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image test sets. A Laplacian or Lasso-like prior outperformed both Gaussian and uniform priors.",

        "abstract": "In order to solve the problem of high torque of magnetic gears, this paper proposes two topological structures of permanent magnet planetary gear motors, that is, a permanent magnet planetary gear motor with six planetary wheels and a permanent magnet planetary gear motor with three planetary wheels. Compare the magnetic field distribution and electromagnetic torque of two kinds of permanent magnet planetary gear motors, including the radial magnetic flux density, tangential magnetic flux density. The calculation results show that with the same structural parameters, the permanent magnet planetary gear motors with six planetary gears can provide better decoupling and larger torque, and the losses of the two permanent magnet planetary gear motors are basically the same. The research results lay a theoretical foundation for further research on the new permanent magnet planetary gear motor.",

        "title": "Prediction of DC magnetic fields for magnetic cleanliness on spacecraft",
        "year": 2011,
        "abstract": "Magnetometry is among the most used techniques in space exploration, e.g. to study complex plasma interactions between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, to map the planetary or interplanetary magnetic fields, or to retrieve information about the structural composition of planets. The success of each mission relies on the attainment of an adequate level of magnetic cleanliness at the sensor locations. At the European Space Agency (ESA) a prediction tool has been developed to simulate the far-field spurious magnetic field generated by the spacecraft in terms of remanent and induced magnetic dipole moments. Such magnetic dipole moments represent units and components of the satellite. Input data can be obtained from measurements, derived by analysis, or estimated by heritage from previous missions. The development of the analytical tool is finished and will be validated by measurements carried out on the integrated spacecraft in a large magnetic coil facility, and later used to support the definition of the algorithms for processing the flight data of a mission, which is currently under development. The prediction tool will also find useful applications for future missions, for example during the design trade-off for the instrument positioning, e.g. the length of the boom.",
