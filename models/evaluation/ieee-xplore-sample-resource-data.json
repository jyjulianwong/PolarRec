        "title": "Human-Computer Interaction for BCI Games: Usability and User Experience",
        "year": 2010,
        "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) come with a lot of issues, such as delays, bad recognition, long training times, and cumbersome hardware. Gamers are a large potential target group for this new interaction modality, but why would healthy subjects want to use it? BCI provides a combination of information and features that no other input modality can offer. But for general acceptance of this technology, usability and user experience will need to be taken into account when designing such systems. This paper discusses the consequences of applying knowledge from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to the design of BCI for games. The integration of HCI with BCI is illustrated by research examples and showcases, intended to take this promising technology out of the lab. Future research needs to move beyond feasibility tests, to prove that BCI is also applicable in realistic, real-world settings.",

        "abstract": "Stress is defined as organism's total response to environmental conditions or stimuli. It actually defines the condition that has an impact on the individual's mental and physical health. Crossing a stress level (threshold) is responsible for the changes. In this paper we discuss how stress plays an important role in human computer interaction (HCI) and how a human interacts with any problem domain. We will discuss human approach on stand-alone systems and certain devices on which user's final outcome will be fixed and well defined. This study is based upon study on two different age group students (16 to 23 and 21 to 28 age group). We find there is unique similarity in behavior of all people towards computer system. As per study we classify human stress in six categories. The stress is changes from one form to other form as per the task. Human stress affects problem solution, solution time and system usability. Human generate various path towards the solution as well as creates various path towards solution to problem statement and this process is discussed in detail in this paper.",

        "year": 2009,
        "abstract": "Decision tree induction is one of the useful approaches for extracting classification knowledge from a set of feature-based instances. The most popular heuristic information used in the decision tree generation is the minimum entropy. This heuristic information has a serious disadvantage-the poor generalization capability [3]. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classification technique of machine learning based on statistical learning theory. It has good generalization. Considering the relationship between the classification margin of support vector machine(SVM) and the generalization capability, the large margin of SVM can be used as the heuristic information of decision tree, in order to improve its generalization capability. This paper proposes a decision tree induction algorithm based on large margin heuristic. Comparing with the binary decision tree using the minimum entropy as the heuristic information, the experiments show that the generalization capability has been improved by using the new heuristic.",

        "year": 2010,
        "abstract": "In this paper we propose two novel methods of ECG classification to discriminate five heart beat types. The first approach combines principal component analysis (PCA) and modified fuzzy one-against-one (MFOAO) method for multiclass categorization. The fuzzy one-against-one method (FOAO) converts the n-class problem of classification to n(n-1)/2 two-class problems, and performs the binary classification with SVM. It was introduced to solve the problem of the unclassified regions induced by the classical pairwise classification one-against-one. Our novel modified algorithm of FOAO uses fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) for the binary classification in order to discard outliers. The second approach integrates PCA, unbalanced clustering (UC) and FOAO algorithms. PCA is used to extract the principal characteristics of the signal and reduce its dimension. UC algorithm is used to discard outliers, and reduce the training set by replacing samples with prototypes. The first goal of this work is to compare the ability of the two novel methods to discard outliers and enhance the performance of the classification with PCA and FOAO; the second one is to highlight the efficiency of the combined method PCA-UC-FOAO in the classification of long term ECG records.",

        "abstract": "Lie group machine learning is recognized as the theoretical basis of brain intelligence, brain learning, higher machine learning, and higher artificial intelligence. Sample sets of Lie group matrices are widely available in practical applications. Lie group learning is a vibrant field of increasing importance and extraordinary potential and thus needs to be developed further. This study aims to provide a comprehensive survey on recent advances in Lie group machine learning. We introduce Lie group machine learning techniques in three major categories: supervised Lie group machine learning, semisupervised Lie group machine learning, and unsupervised Lie group machine learning. In addition, we introduce the special application of Lie group machine learning in image processing. This work covers the following techniques: Lie group machine learning model, Lie group subspace orbit generation learning, symplectic group learning, quantum group learning, Lie group fiber bundle learning, Lie group cover learning, Lie group deep structure learning, Lie group semisupervised learning, Lie group kernel learning, tensor learning, frame bundle connection learning, spectral estimation learning, Finsler geometric learning, homology boundary learning, category representation learning, and neuromorphic synergy learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful overview of state-of-the-art development in the field of Lie group machine learning. It will enable researchers to comprehensively understand the state of the field, identify the most appropriate tools for particular applications, and identify directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "We present the first 3D prints of output from a supercomputer simulation of a complex astrophysical system, the colliding stellar winds in the massive (\u2273120\u00a0M\u2299), highly eccentric (e\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.9) binary star system \u03b7 Carinae. We demonstrate the methodology used to incorporate 3D interactive figures into a PDF (Portable Document Format) journal publication and the benefits of using 3D visualization and 3D printing as tools to analyse data from multidimensional numerical simulations. Using a consumer-grade 3D printer (MakerBot Replicator 2X), we successfully printed 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of \u03b7 Carinae's inner (r\u00a0\u223c\u00a0110 au) wind\u2013wind collision interface at multiple orbital phases. The 3D prints and visualizations reveal important, previously unknown \u2018finger-like\u2019 structures at orbital phases shortly after periastron (\u03d5\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.045) that protrude radially outwards from the spiral wind\u2013wind collision region. We speculate that these fingers are related to instabilities (e.g. thin-shell, Rayleigh\u2013Taylor) that arise at the interface between the radiatively cooled layer of dense post-shock primary-star wind and the fast (3000\u00a0km\u2009s\u22121), adiabatic post-shock companion-star wind. The success of our work and easy identification of previously unrecognized physical features highlight the important role 3D printing and interactive graphics can play in the visualization and understanding of complex 3D time-dependent numerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena.",

        "abstract": "A three-dimensional hydrodynamic code is used to test a newly developed parallel C++ (pC++) language and compiler. The original code is written in FORTRAN77 and is designed to model self-gravitating compressible gas flows. The code is rewritten in pC++ and is tested on a BBN GP1000 and an Alliant FX/2800. Nearly linear speed-up is achieved on both machines. On the Alliant comparison between the pC++ code and the original FORTRAN77 code is conducted. For processor numbers >or=6, the pC++ code outperforms the FORTRAN77 code which is automatically vectorized and parallelized by the Alliant FORTRAN compiler.<>",
