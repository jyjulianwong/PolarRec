        "abstract": "Turing's 1950 paper introduced the famed \"imitation game\", a test originally\nproposed to capture the notion of machine intelligence. Over the years, the\nTuring test spawned a large amount of interest, which resulted in several\nvariants, as well as heated discussions and controversy. Here we sidestep the\nquestion of whether a particular machine can be labeled intelligent, or can be\nsaid to match human capabilities in a given context. Instead, but inspired by\nTuring, we draw attention to the seemingly simpler challenge of determining\nwhether one is interacting with a human or with a machine, in the context of\neveryday life. We are interested in reflecting upon the importance of this\nHuman-or-Machine question and the use one may make of a reliable answer\nthereto. Whereas Turing's original test is widely considered to be more of a\nthought experiment, the Human-or-Machine question as discussed here has obvious\npractical significance. And while the jury is still not in regarding the\npossibility of machines that can mimic human behavior with high fidelity in\neveryday contexts, we argue that near-term exploration of the issues raised\nhere can contribute to development methods for computerized systems, and may\nalso improve our understanding of human behavior in general.",

        "abstract": "The traditional user-centered design process can hardly keep up with the ever\nfaster technical development and increasingly diverse user preferences. As a\nsolution, we propose to augment the tried-and-tested approach of conducting\nuser studies with simulation and optimization of the entire human-computer\ninteraction loop. This approach allows to better understand phenomena through\nexplicit modeling, build virtual prototypes through simulation, and improve\ninteraction techniques through optimization. Building predictive user models\nalso supports the creation and validation of HCI theories, and constitutes a\ndecisive step towards new, intelligent, and adaptive user interfaces. We report\nour experience in virtually developing new interaction techniques on the\nexample of acoustic levitation, and present our optimization-based framework\nfor HCI. With this, we strive to gain a better understanding of interaction and\nat the same time feed the discussion on questions such as which tools and\ntutorials are necessary to make virtual prototyping more accessible to\ndifferent audiences.",

        "abstract": "Timelines are common visualizations to represent and manipulate temporal\ndata, from historical events storytelling to animation authoring. However,\ntimeline visualizations rarely consider spatio-temporal 3D data (e.g. mesh or\nvolumetric models) directly, which are typically explored using 3D visualizers\nonly displaying one time-step at a time. In this paper, leveraging the\nincreased workspace and 3D interaction capabilities of virtual reality, we\npropose to use timelines for the visualization of 3D temporal data to support\nexploration and analysis. First, we propose a timeline design space for 3D\ntemporal data extending the timeline design space proposed by Brehmer et al.\nThe proposed design space adapts the scale, layout and representation\ndimensions to account for the depth dimension and how 3D temporal data can be\npartitioned and structured. In our approach, an additional dimension is\nintroduced, the support, which further characterizes the 3D dimension of the\nvisualization. To complement the design space and the interaction capabilities\nof VR systems, we discuss the interaction methods required for the efficient\nvisualization of 3D timelines. Then, to evaluate the benefits of 3D timelines,\nwe conducted a formal evaluation with two main objectives: comparing the\nproposed visualization with a traditional visualization method; exploring how\nusers interact with different 3D timeline designs. Our results showed that\ntime-related tasks can be achieved more comfortably using timelines, and more\nefficiently for specific tasks requiring the analysis of the surrounding\ntemporal context. Though the comparison between the different timeline designs\nwere inconclusive, participants reported a clear preference towards the\ntimeline design that did not occupy the vertical space. Finally, we illustrate\nthe use of the 3D timelines to a real use-case on the analysis of biological 3D\ntemporal datasets.",

        "year": 2023,
        "month": 5,
        "abstract": "Deep learning models developed for time-series associated tasks have become\nmore widely researched nowadays. However, due to the unintuitive nature of\ntime-series data, the interpretability problem -- where we understand what is\nunder the hood of these models -- becomes crucial. The advancement of similar\nstudies in computer vision has given rise to many post-hoc methods, which can\nalso shed light on how to explain time-series models. In this paper, we present\na wide range of post-hoc interpretation methods for time-series models based on\nbackpropagation, perturbation, and approximation. We also want to bring focus\nonto inherently interpretable models, a novel category of interpretation where\nhuman-understandable information is designed within the models. Furthermore, we\nintroduce some common evaluation metrics used for the explanations, and propose\nseveral directions of future researches on the time-series interpretability\nproblem. As a highlight, our work summarizes not only the well-established\ninterpretation methods, but also a handful of fairly recent and under-developed\ntechniques, which we hope to capture their essence and spark future endeavours\nto innovate and improvise.",

        "year": 2023,
        "month": 5,
        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), especially dynamic GNNs, have become a research\nhotspot in spatio-temporal forecasting problems. While many dynamic graph\nconstruction methods have been developed, relatively few of them explore the\ncausal relationship between neighbour nodes. Thus, the resulting models lack\nstrong explainability for the causal relationship between the neighbour nodes\nof the dynamically generated graphs, which can easily lead to a risk in\nsubsequent decisions. Moreover, few of them consider the uncertainty and noise\nof dynamic graphs based on the time series datasets, which are ubiquitous in\nreal-world graph structure networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic\nDiffusion-Variational Graph Neural Network (DVGNN) for spatio-temporal\nforecasting. For dynamic graph construction, an unsupervised generative model\nis devised. Two layers of graph convolutional network (GCN) are applied to\ncalculate the posterior distribution of the latent node embeddings in the\nencoder stage. Then, a diffusion model is used to infer the dynamic link\nprobability and reconstruct causal graphs in the decoder stage adaptively. The\nnew loss function is derived theoretically, and the reparameterization trick is\nadopted in estimating the probability distribution of the dynamic graphs by\nEvidence Lower Bound during the backpropagation period. After obtaining the\ngenerated graphs, dynamic GCN and temporal attention are applied to predict\nfuture states. Experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets of\ndifferent graph structures in different domains. The results demonstrate that\nthe proposed DVGNN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves\noutstanding Root Mean Squared Error result while exhibiting higher robustness.\nAlso, by F1-score and probability distribution analysis, we demonstrate that\nDVGNN better reflects the causal relationship and uncertainty of dynamic\ngraphs.",

        "abstract": "Neural network-based decisions tend to be overconfident, where their raw\noutcome probabilities do not align with the true decision probabilities.\nCalibration of neural networks is an essential step towards more reliable deep\nlearning frameworks. Prior metrics of calibration error primarily utilize crisp\nbin membership-based measures. This exacerbates skew in model probabilities and\nportrays an incomplete picture of calibration error. In this work, we propose a\nFuzzy Calibration Error metric (FCE) that utilizes a fuzzy binning approach to\ncalculate calibration error. This approach alleviates the impact of probability\nskew and provides a tighter estimate while measuring calibration error. We\ncompare our metric with ECE across different data populations and class\nmemberships. Our results show that FCE offers better calibration error\nestimation, especially in multi-class settings, alleviating the effects of skew\nin model confidence scores on calibration error estimation.

        "abstract": "In exoplanetary systems, the interaction between the central star and the\nplanet can trigger Auroral Radio Emission (ARE), due to the Electron Cyclotron\nMaser mechanism. The high brightness temperature of this emission makes it\nvisible at large distances, opening new opportunities to study exoplanets and\nto search for favourable conditions for the development of extra-terrestrial\nlife, as magnetic fields act as a shield that protects life against external\nparticles and influences the evolution of the planetary atmospheres. In the\nlast few years, we started an observational campaign to observe a sample of\nnearby M-type stars known to host exoplanets with the aim to detect ARE. We\nobserved YZ Ceti with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in\nband 4 (550-900 MHz) nine times over a period of five months. We detected radio\nemission four times, two of which with high degree of circular polarization.\nWith statistical considerations we exclude the possibility of flares due to\nstellar magnetic activity. Instead, when folding the detections to the orbital\nphase of the closest planet YZ Cet b, they are at positions where we would\nexpect ARE due to star-planet interaction (SPI) in sub-Alfvenic regime. With a\ndegree of confidence higher than 4.37 sigma, YZ Cet is the first extrasolar\nsystems with confirmed SPI at radio wavelengths. Modelling the ARE, we estimate\na magnetic field for the star of about 2.4 kG and we find that the planet must\nhave a magnetosphere. The lower limit for the polar magnetic field of the\nplanet is 0.4 G.",

        "abstract": "Observations of substructure in protoplanetary disks have largely been\nlimited to the brightest and largest disks, excluding the abundant population\nof compact disks which are likely sites of planet formation. Here, we reanalyze\n~0.1'', 1.33 mm ALMA continuum observations of 12 compact protoplanetary disks\nin the Taurus star-forming region. By fitting visibilities directly, we\nidentify substructures in 6 of the 12 compact disks. We then compare the\nsubstructures identified in the full Taurus sample of 24 disks in single star\nsystems and the ALMA DSHARP survey, differentiating between compact (R_eff,90%\n< 50 au) and extended (R_eff,90% > 50 au) disk sources. We find that\nsubstructures are detected at nearly all radii in both small and large disks.\nTentatively, we find fewer wide gaps in intermediate-sized disks with R_eff,90%\nbetween 30 and 90 au. We perform a series of planet-disk interaction\nsimulations to constrain the sensitivity of our visibility-fitting approach.\nUnder an assumption of planet-disk interaction, we use the gap widths and\ncommon disk parameters to calculate potential planet masses within the Taurus\nsample. We find that the young planet occurrence rate peaks near Neptune\nmasses, similar to the DSHARP sample. For 0.01 $M_J/M_\\odot$ $\\lesssim$\n$M_p/M_*$ $\\lesssim$ 0.1 $M_J/M_\\odot$, the rate is 17.4$\\pm$8.3%; for 0.1\n$M_J/M_\\odot$ $\\lesssim$ $M_p/M_*$ $\\lesssim$ 1 $M_J/M_\\odot$, it is\n27.8$\\pm$8.3%.

        "abstract": "Current research indicates that (sub)surface ocean worlds essentially devoid\nof subaerial landmasses (e.g., continents) are common in the Milky Way, and\nthat these worlds could host habitable conditions, thence raising the\npossibility that life and technological intelligence (TI) may arise in such\naquatic settings. It is known, however, that TI on Earth (i.e., humans) arose\non land. Motivated by these considerations, we present a Bayesian framework to\nassess the prospects for the emergence of TIs in land- and ocean-based habitats\n(LBHs and OBHs). If all factors are equally conducive for TIs to arise in LBHs\nand OBHs, we demonstrate that the evolution of TIs in LBHs (which includes\nhumans) might have very low odds of roughly $1$-in-$10^3$ to $1$-in-$10^4$,\nthus outwardly contradicting the Copernican Principle. Hence, we elucidate\nthree avenues whereby the Copernican Principle can be preserved: (i) the\nemergence rate of TIs is much lower in OBHs, (ii) the habitability interval for\nTIs is much shorter in OBHs, and (iii) only a small fraction of worlds with\nOBHs comprise appropriate conditions for effectuating TIs. We also briefly\ndiscuss methods for empirically falsifying our predictions, and comment on the\nfeasibility of supporting TIs in aerial environments.",
