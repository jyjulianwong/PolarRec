        "year": 2023,
        "month": 4,
        "abstract": "Using English words as passwords have been a popular topic in the last few\nyears. The following article discusses a study to compare self-selection of the\nsystem-generated words for recognition and self-generated words for recall for\nnouns and mixture words. The results revealed no significant difference between\nrecognition and recall of password nouns. The average memorability rate of noun\nrecognition was 75.72%, slightly higher than noun recall 74.23% in long-term\nmemory. Also, there was no significant difference between recognition and\nrecall mixture word passwords. The average memorability rate of mixture word\nrecognition was 95.23%, and recall was 84.14% in long-term memory. The authors\nconcluded that the recognition and recall of mixed word passwords had a higher\nmemorability rate than nouns.",

        "abstract": "Energy Expenditure Estimation (EEE) is vital for maintaining weight, managing\nchronic diseases, achieving fitness goals, and improving overall health and\nwell-being. Gold standard measurements for energy expenditure are expensive and\ntime-consuming, hence limiting utility and adoption. Prior work has used\nwearable sensors for EEE as a workaround. Moreover, earables (ear-worn sensing\ndevices such as earbuds) have recently emerged as a sub-category of wearables\nwith unique characteristics (i.e., small form factor, high adoption) and\npositioning on the human body (i.e., robust to motion, high stability, facing\nthin skin), opening up a novel sensing opportunity. However, earables with\nmultimodal sensors have rarely been used for EEE, with data collected in\nmultiple activity types. Further, it is unknown how earable sensors perform\ncompared to standard wearable sensors worn on other body positions. In this\nstudy, using a publicly available dataset gathered from 17 participants, we\nevaluate the EEE performance using multimodal sensors of earable devices to\nshow that an MAE of 0.5 MET (RMSE = 0.67) can be achieved. Furthermore, we\ncompare the EEE performance of three commercial wearable devices with the\nearable, demonstrating competitive performance of earables",

        "abstract": "The recent development of scalable Bayesian inference methods has renewed\ninterest in the adoption of Bayesian learning as an alternative to conventional\nfrequentist learning that offers improved model calibration via uncertainty\nquantification. Recently, federated averaging Langevin dynamics (FALD) was\nintroduced as a variant of federated averaging that can efficiently implement\ndistributed Bayesian learning in the presence of noiseless communications. In\nthis paper, we propose wireless FALD (WFALD), a novel protocol that realizes\nFALD in wireless systems by integrating over-the-air computation and\nchannel-driven sampling for Monte Carlo updates. Unlike prior work on wireless\nBayesian learning, WFALD enables (\\emph{i}) multiple local updates between\ncommunication rounds; and (\\emph{ii}) stochastic gradients computed by\nmini-batch. A convergence analysis is presented in terms of the 2-Wasserstein\ndistance between the samples produced by WFALD and the targeted global\nposterior distribution. Analysis and experiments show that, when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large, channel noise can be fully\nrepurposed for Monte Carlo sampling, thus entailing no loss in performance.",

        "abstract": "Neural network-based decisions tend to be overconfident, where their raw\noutcome probabilities do not align with the true decision probabilities.\nCalibration of neural networks is an essential step towards more reliable deep\nlearning frameworks. Prior metrics of calibration error primarily utilize crisp\nbin membership-based measures. This exacerbates skew in model probabilities and\nportrays an incomplete picture of calibration error. In this work, we propose a\nFuzzy Calibration Error metric (FCE) that utilizes a fuzzy binning approach to\ncalculate calibration error. This approach alleviates the impact of probability\nskew and provides a tighter estimate while measuring calibration error. We\ncompare our metric with ECE across different data populations and class\nmemberships. Our results show that FCE offers better calibration error\nestimation, especially in multi-class settings, alleviating the effects of skew\nin model confidence scores on calibration error estimation.

Such complexities can be greatly reduced by\nintroducing higher-level abstractions -- role and channel -- using which\nfederated learning applications are described as Topology Abstraction Graphs\n(TAGs). TAGs decouple the ML application logic from the underlying deployment\ndetails, making it possible to specialize the application deployment, thus\nreducing development effort and paving the way for improved automation and\ntuning. We present Flame, the first system that supports these abstractions,\nand demonstrate its benefits for several use cases.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we carried out photometric, spectroscopic, and for the first\ntime, polarimetric observations of the Amor-type near-Earth asteroid (2059)\nBaboquivari. Our findings represent the first reliable determination of\nBaboquivari's physical properties. We used data from a 1m-class telescope\n(T100) along with ALCDEF data for photometric analyses and a 1.5-m-class\ntelescope (RTT150) for polarimetric, spectroscopic, and additional photometric\nobservations. We obtained the synodic rotation period of Baboquivari as 129.93\n+/- 2.31 hours and the standard phase function parameters H and G as 16.05 +/-\n0.05, 0.22 +/- 0.02, respectively. Our colour index (V-R) measurement of 0.45\n+/- 0.02 is consistent with spectroscopic observations, indicating an S (or\nsub-S) spectral type. Using the polarimetric and spectroscopic data, we found\nthat the geometric albedo is 0.15 +/- 0.03, and the spectral type is Sq. Based\non the estimated albedo and absolute magnitude, Baboquivari has an effective\ndiameter of 2.12 +/- 0.21 km. Due to the scattered data in the light curve, its\nslow rotation and location among the NEAs suggest that Baboquivari may be a\nnon-principal axis (NPA) rotator.",

        "abstract": "Context. Upcoming space missions will provide us with surface-resolved NEA\nreflectance spectra. Neural networks are useful tools for analysing reflectance\nspectra and determining material composition with high precision and low\nprocessing time. Aims. We applied neural-network models on disk-resolved\nspectra of the Eros and Itokawa asteroids observed by the NEAR Shoemaker and\nHayabusa spacecraft. With this approach, the mineral variations or intensity of\nspace weathering can be mapped. Methods. We tested two types of convolutional\nneural networks. The first one was trained using asteroid reflectance spectra\nwith known taxonomy classes. The other one used silicate reflectance spectra\nwith assigned mineral abundances and compositions. Results. The reliability of\nthe classification model depends on the resolution of reflectance spectra.\nTypical F1 score and Cohen's ${\\kappa}_C$ values decrease from about 0.90 for\nhigh-resolution spectra to about 0.70 for low-resolution spectra. The predicted\nsilicate composition does not strongly depend on spectrum resolution and\ncoverage of the 2${\\mu}$m band of pyroxene. The typical root mean square error\nis between 6 and 10 percentage points. For the Eros and Itokawa asteroids, the\npredicted taxonomy classes favour the S-type and the predicted surface\ncompositions are homogeneous and correspond to the composition of L/LL and LL\nordinary chondrites, respectively. On the Itokawa surface, the model identified\nfresh spots that were connected with craters or coarse-grain areas.\nConclusions. The neural network models trained with measured spectra of\nasteroids and silicate samples are suitable for deriving surface silicate\nmineralogy with a reasonable level of accuracy. The predicted surface\nmineralogy is comparable to the mineralogy of returned samples measured in the\nlaboratory. Moreover, the taxonomical predictions can point out locations of\nfresher areas.",

        "abstract": "Observations of substructure in protoplanetary disks have largely been\nlimited to the brightest and largest disks, excluding the abundant population\nof compact disks which are likely sites of planet formation. Here, we reanalyze\n~0.1'', 1.33 mm ALMA continuum observations of 12 compact protoplanetary disks\nin the Taurus star-forming region. By fitting visibilities directly, we\nidentify substructures in 6 of the 12 compact disks. We then compare the\nsubstructures identified in the full Taurus sample of 24 disks in single star\nsystems and the ALMA DSHARP survey, differentiating between compact (R_eff,90%\n< 50 au) and extended (R_eff,90% > 50 au) disk sources. We find that\nsubstructures are detected at nearly all radii in both small and large disks.\nTentatively, we find fewer wide gaps in intermediate-sized disks with R_eff,90%\nbetween 30 and 90 au. We perform a series of planet-disk interaction\nsimulations to constrain the sensitivity of our visibility-fitting approach.\nUnder an assumption of planet-disk interaction, we use the gap widths and\ncommon disk parameters to calculate potential planet masses within the Taurus\nsample. We find that the young planet occurrence rate peaks near Neptune\nmasses, similar to the DSHARP sample. For 0.01 $M_J/M_\\odot$ $\\lesssim$\n$M_p/M_*$ $\\lesssim$ 0.1 $M_J/M_\\odot$, the rate is 17.4$\\pm$8.3%; for 0.1\n$M_J/M_\\odot$ $\\lesssim$ $M_p/M_*$ $\\lesssim$ 1 $M_J/M_\\odot$, it is\n27.8$\\pm$8.3%. Both of them are consistent with microlensing surveys. For gas\ngiants more massive than 5 $M_J$, the occurrence rate is 4.2$\\pm$4.2%,\nconsistent with direct imaging surveys.",
