# Evaluation

This directory contains modules used for the quantitative evaluation process of the project. Running the `if __name__ == "__main__"` section of each `.py` file (except `sample_resources.py`) calculates an overall evaluation metric for the recommendation algorithm. For each metric, the recommendation algorithm is run multiple times using a different sample target academic resource each time, and the average of all the runs is used as the final overall metric value.

| `classification.py`     | Calculates the macro- and micro-classification precision of the algorithm, i.e. how many of the top recommended resources belong in the same subject area(s) as the target.                                                                            |
| `keyword_extraction.py` | Calculates the keyword extraction precision of the algorithm, i.e. how many of the top keywords extracted from the target resource match the pre-defined keywords set by the author / academic database.                                               |
| `recommendation.py`     | Calculates the recommendation precision of the algorithm. This uses the Semantic Scholar Recommendations API (S2R) as a gold standard, and compares how many of the top recommended resources generated by our algorithm match those generated by S2R. |
| `sample_resources.py`   | Custom library for collecting sample resource metadata from academic databases, and for saving and loading sample resource metadata to and from persistent JSON files.                                                                                 |
