# Models

This directory contains libraries, modules, and class definitions for the main bulk of the recommendation algorithm. Most `.py` files can be run independently as executables, where the output and the code in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` section demonstrate the functionality of the code in the file, act as intermediate test code to verify the correctness of the code during development, and provide examples of the typical use cases of the code. For example, the output of `models/recommend.py` takes a sample academic resource and prints the titles and authors of recommendations generated by the algorithm.

| `models/resource_rankers`           | Class definition of the `Ranker` interface and its concrete implementations. A "ranker" gives a positional ranking for each resource in a list of candidate resources based on a specific criteria, such as author similarity, citation similarity, and keyword similarity to the target(s). The combination of multiple rankers generates the final average ranking used to sort the candidates, forming the output of the algorithm. |

| `models/recommendation.py`   | Contains the main recommendation algorithm. Utilises most other libraries, modules, and classes in the application and coordinates function calls to each of them to form the main algorithm. Takes in fields as defined by this application's API (in `./README.md`) and outputs lists of recommended academic resources.                                                                                                                                                       |

It contains all the metadata necessary for the algorithm to rank candidate resources based on their relevance with the target(s). Its structure can be found in this application's API (in `./README.md`), where the API takes in lists of resources and also outputs lists of resources. |
